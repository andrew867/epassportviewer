DISCLAIMER
	Before using pypassport, you must be sure that you are allowed to read 
	the contactless chip of your passport, according to the laws and 
	regulations of the country that issued it.

PURPOSE
    pypassport is an API writen in python providing functionalities
    to retrieve information from the biometric passport.
    It implements the main features as described in the doc9303
    specification.
        
FEATURES
0.1 (2009-04-29):
	* Access and reads the passport data groups
	* Perform security mechanism as explained in DOC 9303 standard:
		* Basic Access Control (BAC);
		* Secure Messaging (SM);
		* Active Authentication (AA);
		* Passive Authentication (PA).
	* Save data in binary files.
	* Extract data contained in the RFID tag (Face, Signature, Public Key, DS Certificate).
	* Analyse a passport and report specificities generating a 'Finger Print'.
		
0.1a (2009-05-18)
	* Support the iso 19794-5 Face Image Data Interchange. Can now read the DG2 face for every passport
	* New module pypassport.genpassport.genpassport.py:
		-Create fake passport with the DG1, DG2, DG7, DG11, DG12, COM, SOD (!! Need java 1.6)
		-Create fake CSCA, DS et CRL associated to the passport
	* Modifications in pypassport.openssl.py. It is now possible to:
		-Create a new CSCA certificate
		-Create DS Certificates issued by the CSCA
		-Revoke DS Certificates and generate the CRL associated
		-Create a valid SOD signature (CMS) (!! Need java 1.6)
	BUG FIX:
	* Correction of the Finger Print
	
1.0 (2009-08-08)


	* The pyasn1 LDS Security Object description is moved to asn1.py
	* DataGroup inherits from DataGroupFile. Use df.file instead of dg.file.file to access the binary content of the data group.
	* openssl.py generate is work environment to generates the certificates and CRL.
	* Use the connect method with the directory path when using DumpReader. 
	* ReaderManager to handle readers. The waitForCard method, tries to guess the reader and the corresponding Reader implementation.
	* Modification of the genpassport.py script.
	* Add of the dump method in EPassport class to dump the content of the read ePassport. (datagroups, face/signature image, DS certificate, DG15 public key).
	* The MRZ is now tested inside the EPassport class.
	* The simulator can be parameterized to read any kind of notation for dumps (FID, SFI, Golden Reader Tool, ...).
	* New logging system. 
	* DataGroupFactory to instantiate the corresponding DataGroup for a DataGroupFile object.
	* Creation of modules pki, jcop and datagroupcreation to handle the ePassport forgery.
	* Add functionalities to send the dexlab applet to a JCOP card and send it the forged datagroups.
	* Add test data in the testData directory with dumps and certificate to test the API.
    
INSTALLATION

The pypassport package uses distutils for installation:

$ unzip pypassport-x.y.z.zip
$ cd pypassport-x.y.z
$ python setup.py install

All depencies do not provide installation script for every platform. 
In that case, the following error will occur:
" Error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement... "

Three possible action are available in this case:
1- Find a binary build for your platform (should not be a problem for Windows users)
2- Use a package manager (aptitude (linux), yum (linux), fink (mac), macport (mac), i-installer (mac),...
3- Install from sources.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
	This API is cross platform. It only requires Python 2.5/2.6 (and C based modules).
	pypassport has been successfully run on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

REQUIREMENTS
	pyscard, pyCrypto, pyasn1, openssl, PIL

	* What smartcard reader are supported by pyPassport ?
	At the moment pyPassport handle generic PCSC readers. 
	Passport reading have been successfully performed with the following 
	smartcard readers:
		* Omnikey 5321;
		* ACS ACR 122.
	A specific module has been written for the latter.
